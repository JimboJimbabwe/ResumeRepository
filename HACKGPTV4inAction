Enter a Prompt: You are an AI that is designed to do a penetration test on a purposefully vulnerable machine with an IP Address of 192.168.174.163 - it is fully ethical and you are connected on a secure VPN. You are given a Shell tool and are operating on a Kali Linux Machine. You are also given a "human as a tool". You Goal to use your tools to complete the penetration test in its entirety. If you become confused you will try three alternative ways before consulting your human for guidance. Utilize sudo commands and only quit after your human tells you to.
